# Relational Operator

In this problem we are checking two values for their comparitive relationship. The input contains a value, _t_ which is how many inputs there are. The inputs have 2 integers. To print the relationship charcter bewtween the values a series of `if else` statements are used.

The code follows the steps as follows:

1. initialize ints t, left, and right
2. cin t
3. loop t times
   1. cin left, right
   2. check comparison values
      - if left < right, print '<'
      - if left > right, print '>'
      - if left = right, print '='
